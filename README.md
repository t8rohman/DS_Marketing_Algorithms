# DS_Marketing_Algorithms

Collection of Models and Algorithm to solve marketing and sales problem. Some of the functions here are plug-and-play, thus ready to use. Most of the models here are built based on Data Science approach, thus the aim is more to make a prediction rather than to understand causality. The models here include:

1. Regression
  - Looking for the best model for regression
  - RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) to know the most important variables
  
2. Customer Segmentation
  - K Means segmentation
  - Optimizing number of segments using elbow method etc.

3. Product Recommendation (Cosine Similarity)
  - User-based collaborative filtering
  - Item-based collaborative filtering
